# Narrative Structure Techniques

Structure your video explainer for maximum comprehension and engagement.

## Problem-Solution

Classic structure: Present problem, build tension, reveal solution.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (problem teaser)
2. Problem deep-dive
3. Failed approaches (optional)
4. Solution introduction
5. Solution explanation
6. Results/proof
7. Call to action

**When to use:** Tutorials, case studies, technical explanations
**Duration:** Works for any length

## Concept Ladder

Build understanding progressively, each concept enabling the next.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (end result preview)
2. Foundation concept
3. Building block 1
4. Building block 2
5. Synthesis (how they combine)
6. Advanced application
7. Recap + CTA

**When to use:** Complex technical topics, educational content
**Duration:** Best for 5+ minutes

## Before/After

Show transformation, then explain how.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (dramatic after)
2. Before state
3. The change/intervention
4. Step-by-step process
5. After state (detailed)
6. Why it works
7. CTA

**When to use:** Transformations, optimizations, tutorials
**Duration:** Works well for short-form

## Myth-Busting

Challenge common beliefs, reveal truth.

**Structure:**
1. Hook (provocative question)
2. Common belief
3. Why people believe it
4. The reality
5. Evidence/proof
6. Implications
7. CTA

**When to use:** Correcting misconceptions, thought leadership
**Duration:** Best for 3-10 minutes

## Platform Adaptation

- **Short-form (< 60s)**: Use Before/After or compressed Problem-Solution
- **Medium (1-5 min)**: Any structure, prioritize Problem-Solution
- **Long-form (5+ min)**: Concept Ladder for complex topics

## Pacing Guidelines

| Platform | Target WPM | Sentence Length |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| YouTube | 140-160 | Medium |
| Shorts/TikTok | 160-180 | Short |
| LinkedIn | 130-150 | Medium-Long |

Adjust pacing based on content complexity - technical content needs slower pacing.
