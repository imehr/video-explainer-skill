# Platform Optimization Techniques

Optimize video content for each platform's unique requirements and algorithm preferences.

## YouTube (16:9 Landscape)

**Technical:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 3840x2160
- Duration: No limit, but 8-15 min optimal for algorithm
- Safe zones: Minimal concern

**Content:**
- Front-load value (algorithm measures early retention)
- Include chapters/timestamps for long videos
- End screen compatible outro (last 20s)
- Pattern interrupts every 30-60s for retention

**What works:**
- Detailed explanations
- Complete tutorials
- In-depth analysis

## YouTube Shorts (9:16 Vertical)

**Technical:**
- Resolution: 1080x1920
- Duration: Max 60s (aim for 30-45s)
- Safe zones: Top 120px, bottom 100px (for UI)

**Content:**
- Hook in first 1-2 seconds
- Single concept per short
- Loop-friendly ending (viewers re-watch)
- Text on screen for sound-off viewing

**What works:**
- Quick tips
- Surprising facts
- Before/after reveals

## TikTok (9:16 Vertical)

**Technical:**
- Resolution: 1080x1920
- Duration: Max 3 min (15-60s performs best)
- Safe zones: Top 150px, bottom 120px

**Content:**
- Hook in first 0.5-1 second
- Native feel (not overly produced)
- Trending sounds/music integration
- Face-to-camera or POV perspective preferred

**What works:**
- Authentic, unpolished content
- Quick tutorials
- Relatable pain points

## Instagram Reels (9:16 Vertical)

**Technical:**
- Resolution: 1080x1920
- Duration: Max 90s (15-30s optimal)
- Safe zones: Similar to TikTok

**Content:**
- Aesthetic quality matters more than TikTok
- Text overlays for sound-off
- Cohesive with brand visual identity
- Strong thumbnail frame

**What works:**
- Visually striking content
- Quick value-packed tips
- Transformation content

## LinkedIn (16:9 Landscape)

**Technical:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Duration: Max 10 min (1-3 min optimal)
- Captions: Essential (most watch muted)

**Content:**
- Professional tone
- Thought leadership angle
- Data/insights focus
- Clear business value

**What works:**
- Industry insights
- Professional tips
- Case studies with metrics

## Cross-Platform Chunking

When adapting long-form to short-form:

1. **Identify standalone moments** - Each chunk must make sense alone
2. **Add context recap** - 2-3 second intro for continuity
3. **Cliffhanger endings** - "Part 2 coming" drives series
4. **Consistent numbering** - "Part 1/5" in text overlay
