# Video Hook Techniques

When generating the opening of a video explainer, select from these techniques based on content type and platform.

## Provocative Question

Ask something counterintuitive that challenges assumptions.

**When to use:** Technical content, myth-busting, surprising insights
**Best for:** YouTube, LinkedIn
**Effectiveness:** High

**Examples:**
- "What if I told you that 90% of your GPU sits idle during LLM inference?"
- "Why do 80% of developers get this wrong?"

## Bold Claim

State a surprising fact or result upfront.

**When to use:** Case studies, tutorials with clear outcomes
**Best for:** All platforms
**Effectiveness:** Medium-High

**Examples:**
- "This one change made our system 10x faster"
- "I built this in 2 hours with no prior experience"

## Pain Point

Describe a relatable frustration your audience has experienced.

**When to use:** Problem-solving content, tutorials
**Best for:** YouTube, shorts
**Effectiveness:** High

**Examples:**
- "Ever spent hours debugging only to find it was a typo?"
- "Tired of your async code becoming spaghetti?"

## Visual Hook

Start with a striking visual, minimal or no narration.

**When to use:** Short-form content, visually dramatic topics
**Best for:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
**Effectiveness:** Very High for short-form

**Examples:**
- Show dramatic before/after transformation
- Display an impressive result, then explain how

1. **Short-form platforms (TikTok, Shorts, Reels)**: Prefer Visual Hook or Pain Point
2. **Long-form educational**: Prefer Provocative Question
3. **Case studies**: Prefer Bold Claim
